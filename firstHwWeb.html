            <p>The internet has grown immensely since it first came into use several decades ago. Tim Berners-Lee brings readers back to the dawn of the internet and reminds us of a very important fundamental of the technology: intellectual and creative freedom. As the internet further embeds itself into our society, we must never forget the freedom we're meant to have within the internet as doing so, according to Berener's Lee, can have drastic impacts on our democracy, liberty, and prosperity.</p>
            <p>I found Berner's point on the decentralization of the internet to be a really interesting point. I haven't really thought about it but the internet truly is a decentralized system. Last semester I was able to attend a panel from the BetterTECH event at NYU and coincidentally, the panel's topic was about the decentralization of the internet. I saw several points resurface such as access to information, right to privacy, come up again in this reading. I also really enjoyed reading about the politics that can go behind the internet when it came to topics such as net neutrality. Net neutrality is so important for the cause of a decentralized internet and a user's personal freedom to see as they please. Thus, seeing how Berners-Lee connected the loss of net neutrality to the loss of freedoms was something that I fully agree with. I enjoyed this reading the most out of the two assigned. It gave a lot of depth and significance to a technology that we may have gotten numb to. I believe it is always crucial to remember the power of the internet so that we can be better responsible about the things we may see online (and ensuring we don't lose our rights to information)!</p>
