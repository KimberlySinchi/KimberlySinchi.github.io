            <p>Conceptualizing something as grand as the internet was unimaginable at the time. Whilst we are far ahead in this technology now, reflecting on how previous generations conceptualized the future can give perspective on the expectations and desires people had and compare how we currently match up to those ideas now.</p>
            <p>It was hard for me to put myself in the shoes of Bush and he deep dove into how he sees technology would evolve in the future. However, I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. The disconnect I felt from the author attested to the technology I grew up in: my cameras, computing machines, and videos are wildly different than what Bush had at the time he wrote his paper. Seeing him describe the benefits of the technology he expects would come in the future furthermore reiterates the ideas of "what do we have this technology for". Technology can connect us academically, personally, and at times quite simply just make things easier. I really liked the part of his paper where he begins describing the "trails" each person has when exploring what was interesting to them. I especially like when he said how the trails of one person when shared can help that person go even further with that trail. I think this idea still exists strongly today, especially with a technology like the internet. We are all so interconnected online through interests, debates, entertainment, etc and each video, webpage, or song we click on is us leaving our digital trail. On our trail we can interact with others who share the same trail, even if only for that moment. To me, this paper read more creatively than anything but it humbled my perspective on what I have now in regards to technology and its possibilities, leading to propserity and freedom.</p>
