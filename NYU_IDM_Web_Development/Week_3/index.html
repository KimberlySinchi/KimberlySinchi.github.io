                    <p>I loved watching Ways of Seeing. It was very interesting seeing how ahead John Berger was in his takes on art and the media. With it now being 2022, there has been plenty of time for users and scholars to truly study and understand the effects modern media has on society; effects that come into play when we choose to <b>frame</b> a fraction of our lives online. Berger impressively touches on many of these topics in his documentary from the 70s. It speaks a lot to his intellect to draw these connections between the digital age and historical European art. Both have played and continue to play integral parts in how we view ourselves. Our <i>perspectives</i> are influenced and shaped by the snapshots we choose to immortalize through any medium.</p>
                    <p>Take for example the many women whom have been the subjects of classic European paintings. These women were popularly painted nude or nearly nude. As Berger questions and analyzes these paintings, his point about what <i>audience</i> these paintings were intended for, shine a light on the skewed perspective that these paintings might have. Say if these paintings were by a male painter, with an audience of the male gaze in mind, wouldn't that imply that perhaps the women we see in these paintings may not be an accurate reflection of reality? Berger's conversation with his incredibly thoughtful female friends shared a lot of thoughts that still strongly resonate today. Women were exaggerated and objectified in these paintings. At times, you could almost <i>feel</i> the discontent these women felt being put on display in the way they were. Talks about imbuing an unrealistic perspective of women (as a result of these paintings), showcase the critical thinking that is necessary when looking at media of any sort. With the power to frame something in any way desirable, you can easily obscure the "undesirable" and spotlight the "desirable". It's an easy trap, but one to be aware of, to ensure that these skewed preceptions of reality do not cycle back to people so that they're believed and those people then further perpetuate those false realities. This was the main message I got from Berger's videos and it was very enlightening to see how powerful the images I may see hundreds of times a day could be slowly manipulating the way I understand reality and myself. </p>
