                <p>I loved watching Ways of Seeing. It was very interesting going through all of different mediums of art and media and understanding their subsconscious and conscious impact on us. For example, the final episode striked me as the most surprising. I was most intrigued by the host's defintion of the word 'glamour' and how it's actually a recently invented concept. I think by this definition of glamour, we can see the shift in art went from flexing personal property to flexing a potential future more clearly.</p>
